# OutlookToTodoist
A simple AppleScript for creating a task from your Mac Outlook client in Todoist.

## Credits
Original Scripting by Matt Horner.  https://github.com/mhorner/OutlookToTodoist

## Addtions

1. Updated the Script to work with Outlook 15.x and moved locaiton to ~Library/Scripts/Applications/Microsoft Outlook so that it more easilly integrates with FastScripts (https://red-sweater.com/fastscripts/).  
2. Changed the folder where the script moves the message to be @Action, which is where I keep items that need action in my GTD system in outlook
3. Added code to flag the message when it is moved to so that it shows up in Outlook's smart mailbox -- "Flagged Mail"
